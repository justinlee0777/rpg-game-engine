Though I've worked on large projects before, I never really inspected what the generated code looked like. When I saw RxJS's ultimate transpilation, I got a bit squeamish.

But I still think Typescript is crucial to web development. After getting to understand the compiler's configurations, I may even say it is a necessity for web development. The ability to express problems in clear, understandable type definitions is an absolute necessity for software development.

I am highly considering building the project with the AssemblyScript-to-WebAssembly compiler as well.
