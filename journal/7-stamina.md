Since every character is intended to have their own set of skills, it doesn't seem to matter if people have varying amounts of stamina - you only need to manipulate the skills' stamina usage to balance these out.

Still, for flexibility, I'll implement stamina per-character for the time being. It is a simple matter of introducing a global stamina if it ought to be standardized across characters.
